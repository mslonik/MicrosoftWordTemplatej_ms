How this file is made:

1. Create completely new, blank Normal.dotm.
	1.1. Backup your current Normal.dotm. Especially if it contains dedicated macros in ThisDocument module.
	1.2. Restart Microsoft Word. New / blank Normal.dotm  will be created by Microsoft Word upon start.

2. Copy this blank Normal.dotm to a new location.
3. Rename it accordingly, e.g. Normal.dotm  →  Macros_ms.dotm.

4. Import macros to your new Macros_ms.dotm template.
	4.1. Restore original Normal.dotm if required.
